Typical use cases include: sharing networking, data storage, internal libraries, and algorithms, but the choice is yours!\r\n\r\nWhile most Android developers love writing their apps in Kotlin, iOS developers are understandably wary of adopting KMM. This talk will give both iOS and Android developers the tools to confidently get started with KMM. This talk will include:\r\n- An introduction of KMM and its benefits.\r\n- A demo showing how to create a basic app with KMM.\r\n- An argument for KMM, based on my research and journey from KMM skeptic to realist. I’ll also share the thoughts and experiences of others.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, I will have covered enough content for teams to get started with KMM in their existing codebases and start reaping the rewards of this exciting new technology.',

And with that, I have always tried different solutions to different community problems I have experienced them myself. And lots of them, FAILED 😞. But even though I experienced so many FAILURES I kept on dreaming and came across a problem in which I have been experiencing ever since I started university, where this forced me to relocate 1500km from my home town to another province.

With less code, you can implement lists or grids in an Android app. No more adapter classes or XML code😊.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll go through implementing lazy lists and grids in Jetpack Compose, adding items, and animating lists content.

          'The goal of this talk is to show how android applications can be used to frontier robotics in the 4th industrial revolution. The project will demonstrate how we have built a flutter mobile application to control an omnidirectional and holonomic robot. This control will be accomplished by varying motor speed and direction, resulting in varying directions of motion. The goal is to have a prototype mobile platform capable of carrying a load of 40 kg that can be controlled remotely using an Android application. This platform will not require manual control but instead be operated remotely via a mobile application software or hand motion control.\r\n',

          "At Sendwave, we wanted to rebuild our data syncing mechanism on Android. That's when we came up with the idea of using a State Machine which helped the team build a much more solid and scalable data syncing system. State Machines are a very good solution for making sense of things that can be quite complex. So many companies are using State Machines as part of their architecture (like Tinder, GoDaddy, Square and more). Some popular architecture patterns like MVI or Redux were inspired by the concept of State Machines. And it has even made some language features possible (Kotlin Coroutines).\r\n\r\nWe will start by understanding State Machines from the ground up and then we will go through all the examples above and will finish by showing how we used a State Machine at Sendwave.",

With the help of an app, show how to structure code to avoid mocking as much as possible.\r\n4. We cannot escape mocking completely, so I will also show with the app example above, how to use mocking when we have to.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this talk is to help developers structure their code better in order to assist them write simple and meaningful unit tests in android. Many are times when code that could be broken down into smaller/simpler structures is lumped in such a way that testing it becomes impossible. Hopefully, at the end of the session, testing can be fun again.',
