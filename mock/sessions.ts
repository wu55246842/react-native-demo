        "Ever wondered how you can build offline first apps whose UI is server-side driven? In this session, we’ll see how you can write an app in Kotlin, be offline first, and heavily rely on Server Side Driven UI to render the UI components.\r\n\r\nI'll dive deeply into the challenges we as developers face when developing offline-first approach apps, and some of the critical lessons I've learned so far. This session will show how a server-side UI approach with Jetpack Compose works, and the implementation details of a stateful approach to building UI Components with compose. I’ll also cover how to test and manage background jobs to ensure users always have up to data on offline-first apps.",
